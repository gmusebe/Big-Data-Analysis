# Big Data
Welcome to the Big Data repository, a testament to my proficiency in Big Data technologies. This project serves as a comprehensive showcase of my skills in leveraging [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery?hl=en), SQL, Python, and [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) to handle large datasets effectively.

My expertise lies in the seamless management of databases, encompassing tasks such as data cleaning, summarization, calculation of summary statistics, and the creation of visually appealing and insightful live dashboards. Through the integration of cloud services and powerful Business Intelligence tools like Tableau, I have demonstrated my ability to analyze data and extract meaningful insights crucial to stakeholders.

Join me on this journey through the intricacies of Big Data, where every line of code and visualization is a reflection of my dedication to excellence in data management and analysis.
